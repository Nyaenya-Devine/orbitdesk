# OrbitDesk Pull Request — Security & Quality Checklist

## Description
<!-- What does this PR do? Why? Link issue if applicable -->

## Type
- [ ] Feature — new lab capability (ticket, voice, remote, chat)
- [ ] Security — hardening, CVE fix, audit, CSP
- [ ] Electron — auto-update, packaging, desktop
- [ ] PWA — installable, offline, TWA/MSIX
- [ ] Bug fix — regression, SLA, UX
- [ ] Docs — README, SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL

## Security Checklist — Zero-Trust Required
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, PATs, API keys (`grep -r ghp_ --exclude=node_modules` clean)
- [ ] No `eval()`, no `innerHTML` with user data, no `nodeIntegration: true`
- [ ] `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`, `webSecurity: true` preserved in electron.js
- [ ] CSP headers updated in next.config.ts if new external origin added
- [ ] Permissions handler updated — microphone only for voice calls, camera/geo blocked
- [ ] Audit logging added for new actions (who, what, when)
- [ ] Tested with `npm run build` — 9/9 routes, no turbopack errors
- [ ] Tested Electron: `npm run desktop` — window opens, no console errors, update check works
